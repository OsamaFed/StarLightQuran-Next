I have an EXISTING project (do NOT recreate or scaffold anything).  
Your task is to refine UI/UX, layout, spacing, responsiveness, theme behavior, 
AND reorganize components + fix PageHeader structure according to the following full specification:

====================================================
GLOBAL LAYOUT, SPACING, AND RESPONSIVENESS
====================================================

1) Fix all excessive spacing:
   - Remove the large empty space above the “StarLight Quran” title on the homepage.
   - Normalize padding/margin across all pages using a consistent spacing scale.
   - Fix header spacing so it is even and visually balanced.

2) Make the entire interface MOBILE-FIRST:
   - Ensure perfect scaling on iPhone screens, then tablets, then desktop.
   - Fix overflow issues, text touching edges, and inconsistent paddings.
   - Use fluid responsive typography and containers (rem, %, clamp()).

3) Apply proper UI / UX principles:
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Consistent spacing rhythm
   - Proper tap target sizes (44px min)
   - Smooth transitions for colors and theme switching
   - Minimal, calm, modern design language
   - Remove unnecessary visual noise

====================================================
GLOBAL THEME SYSTEM (LIGHT / DARK)
====================================================

4) Do NOT rebuild the theme system — just refine it:
   - Keep light & dark modes working globally from the layout.
   - Smooth transitions between themes (CSS transitions).
   - Save theme in localStorage + default to system preference.
   - Theme toggle must be a lightweight sun/moon icon button.

====================================================
PAGE HEADER REFACTOR (VERY IMPORTANT)
====================================================

5) In PageHeader (or the current header file):
   **Split the header functionality into TWO independent components:**
      • BackToggle.jsx  → back button  
      • LightModeToggle.jsx  → theme toggle  

   - These MUST be separate files.  
   - Do NOT merge them into one component.  
   - PageHeader should import and arrange them side-by-side.

6) Organize the layout of PageHeader so:
   - BackToggle appears on the left (or where it belongs in your design).
   - LightModeToggle appears top-right, small, clean, minimal.
   - Header spacing looks refined and consistent.

====================================================
COMPONENTS FOLDER CLEANUP & IMPORT FIXES
====================================================

7) The components folder is currently messy.  
   Clean and restructure it by:

   - Moving ALL component-related imports inside the `/components` directory.
   - Deleting unused imports.
   - Reordering imports cleanly (React → libs → components → styles).
   - Updating all import paths in every file that needs modification.
   - Ensuring components import each other via short & clean relative paths.

8) After cleanup:
   - Provide the NEW `/components` folder structure.
   - Show updated imports across affected files.

====================================================
QURAN READER PAGE (SPECIAL CHANGES)
====================================================

9) Remove the OLD "Back to Home" back button (or old BackToggle) inside the Quran Reader page.
   - Completely delete it.
   - Replace it with the NEW BackToggle component created in the header refactor.

10) NIGHT MODE (Dark):
   - Replace the current white circles in the Quran Reader background with star patterns.
   - Stars must be subtle, soft, and non-distracting.
   - Keep the reading area clean and peaceful.

11) LIGHT MODE:
   - Remove ALL leaf decorations.
   - Leaves appear ONLY in dark mode (night theme).
   - Must switch smoothly when toggling themes.

====================================================
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS (From previous prompt)
====================================================

12) Apply spacing + UI fixes globally:
   - Adjust header padding
   - Unify margins/paddings across all screens
   - Ensure no weird gaps at the top of pages

13) Smooth everything:
   - Smooth page transitions
   - Smooth theme switching
   - Smooth icon interactions

====================================================
DELIVERABLES
====================================================

Return the following:

1. List of ALL edited files  
2. Full code changes or diffs for each file  
3. Updated imports and cleaned file structure  
4. New `/components` folder layout  
5. Short explanation of what was changed and why  
6. Optional improvements or warnings if needed
